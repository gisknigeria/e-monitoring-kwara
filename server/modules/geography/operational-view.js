/**
 * Joins personnel, readiness, incidents, resources, connectivity, CRM signals,
 * results, evidence, tasks and outcomes for one validated Kwara geography scope, at
 * the drill-down/roll-up level implied by how much of the scope was supplied
 * (state -> LGA -> ward -> polling unit). Every list read is bounded by `limit`
 * (capped) and reports its true total rather than returning unbounded arrays.
 *
 * This is a read composition over the existing per-domain repositories (via
 * `store`) rather than a new persistence layer, so it stays consistent with
 * whatever those repositories already enforce (source classification, evidence
 * access rules, sync/versioning) instead of re-implementing it.
